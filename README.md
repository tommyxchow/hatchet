## Background

I've always enjoyed browsing [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) but personally found the web client's UI/UX lacking (it's pretty much the same since launching in [2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20070221033032/https://news.ycombinator.com/)). Although I do like the nostalgic "old web" feeling, UI/UX and design patterns have grown a lot since then.

My goal was to create a web client that aims to "remaster" the Hacker News experience by maintaining its minimalistic nature while bringing in best practices in UI/UX and performance.

Also, I know the "redesign Hacker News" idea has been done a million times already, but I wanted to give my own try at it! Plus, it was a great opportunity for me to get familiar with the newer Next.js App Router and other packages.
